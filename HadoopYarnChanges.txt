Hadoop-YARN Changes:

1. Create enum class RMRequestState : Enumeration of the two states of resource manager's request to subscribed applications to invoke dynamic evaluation of their current state. 
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/RMRequestState.java

2. ApplicationReport add RMRequest. : Added RMRequestState to be published along with YarnApplicationState and FinalApplicationStatus
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ApplicationReport.java

3. RMApp (Interface) add getRMRequestState $hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/rmapp/RMApp.java

4. RMAppImpl. This is where the actual states are set. (currently) $hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/rmapp/RMAppImpl.java
(** For our actual objective, we need to implement RMRequestState trigger in RMServerUtils, where we get access to job queue, container info and others)

5. RMAppManager : added RMRequestState to the summary builder
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/RMAppManager.java

6. Builderutils : Added RMRequest to be set into ApplicationReport
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/utils/BuilderUtils.java

7. ApplicationReportPBImpl : Implements ApplicationReport and all states reported by it in yarnprotos states. Also overrides.
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/impl/pb/ApplicationReportPBImpl.java

8. Yarn_protos.proto : Included RMRequestStates
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/proto/yarn_protos.proto

9. ApplicationHistoryManagerImpl : Maintains application history; modified it to add the history of RMRequest states.
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-applicationhistoryservice/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/applicationhistoryservice/ApplicationHistoryManagerImpl.java

10. ApplicationHistoryData : The class contains all the fields that are stored persistently for RMApp
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-applicationhistoryservice/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/applicationhistoryservice/records/ApplicationHistoryData.java

11. MemoryApplicationHistoryStore
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-applicationhistoryservice/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/applicationhistoryservice/MemoryApplicationHistoryStore.java

12. FileSystemApplicationHistoryStore
$hadoop-2.6.0-src/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-applicationhistoryservice/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/applicationhistoryservice/FileSystemApplicationHistoryStore.java
